# Framewise-Phoneme-Prediction-From-Speech

@ Utilized MFCC features extracted from speech signals to perform framewise phoneme prediction in the data processing.

@ Employed the Deep Neural Network on the LibriSpeech corpus for phoneme classification with an accuracy of 70%.

@ Boosted the classification accuracy to 83% by employing the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network.
